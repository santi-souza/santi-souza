ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Santiago Souza Nava (@santi-souza)

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, computational biology, and the intersection of data science and healthcare. 
I am particularly passionate about applying machine learning techniques to analyze complex biological data and contribute to personalized medicine.

ðŸŒ± I have recently completed my MSc in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, with a thesis titled **"Stroke: Statistical Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Machine Learning Prediction."** 
This project involved leveraging statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to predict stroke occurrences based on complex datasets.

ðŸ’¼ My Experience:
- DNA/RNA extraction, PCR, and Sanger sequencing.
- Omics data analysis, including RNA-Seq, proteomics, and microarrays.
- Proficient in R, Python, SQL, and bioinformatics tools like FASTQC, HISAT2, and GATK.

ðŸ§¬ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that involve bioinformatics, data analysis, and the development of reproducible research pipelines. 
I am eager to contribute to multidisciplinary teams working on cutting-edge research in genomics, transcriptomics, and precision medicine.

âš¡ Fun fact: I have a deep interest in the application of AI to solve complex biological problems, and Iâ€™m always looking for ways to bridge the gap between experimental biology and 
computational analysis.
